###### CONTEXT:
There are many ways you can optimize your website's page load speed.
If you would like to check how else you should optimize your site, you may check out Google's
[Page Speed Tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/).
One way is through serving compressed assets. If you happen to use SVG files,
you may compress them first through gzip.

If you want to use compressed svg files (`image.svg.gz `), and you want to let
S3 serve it as the original svg, make sure your metadata has the following key-value pairs:

``` ruby
Content-Encoding : gzip
Content-Type : image/svg+xml
```
This setting can be done through the Properties tab of your uploaded file within S3 dashboard.

###### PROBLEM:
If you upload your `image.svg.gz` file to S3 using Carrierwave, the file will have
`application/x-gzip` as its Content-Type, and will have nothing for Content-Encoding.

<br>

###### SOLUTION:
My solution was to add modify the uploader file to override both values.
`CarrierWave::MimeTypes` had helper `set_content_type` but, it's been deprecated.
I based my code on the solution
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36016316/with-carrierwavemimetypes-deprecated-how-should-uploaders-handle-overwrite/37738832)

``` ruby
class ImageUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader

  storage :fog
  process :set_content_type

  # some code here

  def set_content_type
    if file.try(:content_type) == 'application/x-gzip'
      file.content_type = 'image/svg+xml'
    end
  end

  # This can also be done in the config file

  def fog_attributes
    file.extension == 'gz' ? {content_encoding: 'gzip'} : {}
  end
end
```
For more config options for `fog-aws`, refer to their [readme](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/master/README.md#using-amazon-s3).
Finally, when you upload your compressed svg file, S3 will serve the original svg file.
