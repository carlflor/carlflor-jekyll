greeting: Hello.

<p class="about-me">I am Carl Flor, a software engineer based in Manila. I build web and mobile apps for
work and for fun. I lead projects at <a class="desc-link" href="https://www.proudcloud.net/" target="_blank">Proudcloud</a>, a Ruby on Rails dev studio.
Outside work, I do a number of projects. One of which is <a class="desc-link" href="http://goodcode.xyz/" target="_blank">Good Code</a>, a pop up coding school geared toward making tech education more accessible to people. I currently teach basic coding ang computational thinking to kids. I like working on projects that are worthwhile and socially relevant.
When I am not coding, I am most likely taking <a class="desc-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/132863000@N07/" target="_blank">pictures</a>, making
 <a class="desc-link" href="https://vimeo.com/carlflor" target="_blank">videos</a>, or <a class="desc-link" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/6fScAIQR0P0xW/giphy.gif" target="_blank">dancing</a>.</p>
